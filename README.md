# MembershipService
The MembershipService microservice is tailored for managing membership within an application
ecosystem. It furnishes RESTful API endpoints for executing CRUD operations on membership data.
Developed using Java technologies and Spring WebFlux, this microservice capitalizes on reactive programming paradigm
to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Limitations and Use Case
This microservice was developed as a practice project to explore reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.  
It is not intended for production use but serves as a learning tool to demonstrate modern Java development practices and principles.

## Technologies Used:
- __Spring Framework:__ Core Framework for building enterprise Java applications.
- __Project Lombok:__ Library for reducing boilerplate code in Java.
- __Spring WebFlux:__ Provides reactive programming support for building asynchronous, non-blocking web applications.
- __Spring Data R2DBC:__ Spring Data module for reactive database access using R2DBC.
- __MapStruct:__ Used for mapping between domain entities and DTOs.
- __JUnit5:__ Testing framework for unit and integration testing in Java.
- __Mockito:__ Framework for creating mock objects in automated testing. 
- __Spring Boot Test:__ Provides testing support for Spring Boot applications.
- __R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity):__ Reactive database driver for relational databases.
- __H2 Database:__ In-memory relational database for development and testing purposes.
- __JSON:__ Data interchange format for communication between the client and the server.

### Conclusion
The MembershipService microservice embodies modern Java development methodologies, integrating robust testing practices, clean architecture,
and reactive programming techniques. These elements collectively ensure the delivery of resilient and scalable membership management functionality.
